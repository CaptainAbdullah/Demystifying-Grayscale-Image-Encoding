# Demystifying Grayscale image encoding
Why we need multiple encoding schemes for grayscale images ?

Grayscale images are commonly represented using 8 bits per pixel, which allows for 256 different intensity values. In this representation:
<li>0 is typically used to represent black, meaning no intensity.</li>
<li>255 is typically used to represent white, indicating maximum intensity.</li>
